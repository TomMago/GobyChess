# GobyChess

This is a chess engine written in python.


You can play it on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/GobyChess).

It currently features:

1. Bitboard move generation
2. Negascout search 
3. Quiescent search
4. Piece-Square table based evaluation
5. Basic UCI implementation

For a reasonable perfomance it is best to run the engine with pypy like in goby.sh.
